                <h3 class="text-center">what is ADA?</h3>
                <p class="ptag-margin">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloremque architecto officiis et consectetur vero nulla minima. Voluptatum delectus reprehenderit ullam nostrum modi saepe, voluptate placeat, fugit quam praesentium harum quidem.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="ptag-margin">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Minima commodi dolores laborum fugit possimus repellat, voluptates placeat aliquid, non ad explicabo cupiditate iusto magni corrupti temporibus inventore iure veniam odio?</p>
    
                <h3 class="text-center">What I did to be selected?</h3>
                <p class="ptag-margin">I first applied with Harambee, an organization that helps young unemployed youth to get a job. Harambee then asked if I was interested in taking a test to see if I would be a suitable candidate to join the program that teaches young females how to code. I was interested so I took the test and passed! I recived an invitation email to spend my day at JoziHub.</p>    
                <br>
                <p class="ptag-margin">On the day, there were so many girls there and then they asked us to create a game in a group. After that day, I recived another email from ADA saying that I was invited to a bootcamp for 3 days. We coded with this browser-based software called “Turtle Academy” - throughout the bootcamp, we learned how to move and draw with the turtle at the end of the second day, we were asked to draw anything and come up with  a drawing of our own. It was really challenging and at that point I became demotivated as other girls created beautiful picture. After a while, I recived a message granting me an opotunity to be a student! Out of 100% of the girls that were initially chosen from the beginning,  I was one of the 2.2% of girls that was selected to be part of ADA.</p>
            
                <h3 class="text-center">How I was selected?</h3>
                <p class="ptag-margin">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Minima commodi dolores laborum fugit possimus repellat, voluptates placeat aliquid, non ad explicabo cupiditate iusto magni corrupti temporibus inventore iure veniam odio?</p>

            <div class="half-journey">
                <h3 class="text-center">My coding journey</h3>
                <p class="ptag-margin">Before starting at ADA, I had never coded before in my life! I honestly thought that you could develop websites with Turtle Academy! I started off by learning what coding is and how it works  and that I was going to learn how to be a front end developer. The lectures taught me about the computer like what a CPU is,  where the memory on a computer is  stored and lots of different shortcuts when working with a laptop. I also learnt that one of the first people to ever code was a woman! we got started with our first coding language HTML.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="ptag-margin">HTML was one of the three coding languages I learned. Getting started was most definitely the challenging because I had to learn how to put things together, know what a boiler plate was and understand that if you don't close an element it won't appear. I had to check for spelling errors cause it might not work if you don’t spell something correct. The second language we learnt was CSS - the pleasant language to learn as it inables one becomes creative with colours, fonts and even animations! CSS makes your work come to life!. The third language was extremely demanding and challenging, but fun because I learned that the user should be able to interact with your website.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="ptag-margin">Knowing what I know now, compared to  where I started, ADA has proven that nothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it. Apart learning how to program, I recived insight on what to do with the skills given to me. I am now able to create a website from nothing, which I am thankful for. The unfortunent part is that if it was not for the pandamic outbreak I would have acquired more skills and knowledge and even gotten an internship.</p>
